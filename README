Rendering OpenStreetMap-Maps with Mapnik
----------------------------------------

In this directory you'll find most of the things you need to render OSM
data into nice maps using the Mapnik renderer.

Note that this is not the code used to generate the "official" OSM tiles
on tile.openstreetmap.org, see
svn.openstreetmap.org/sites/tile.openstreetmap.org for that.


Customzing Files
----------------

If you want to use Mapnik to render OSM data you'll have to do the following:

1. Install or compile Mapnik and osm2pgsl, set up PostGIS and download the
   world_boundaries file as described on
   http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Mapnik

2. Edit 'set-mapnik-env'. Change all the MAPNIK_* environment variable
   definitions to fit your file locations and database parameters.

3. Create a local copy of the Mapnik Map file:
   source ./set-mapnik-env
   ./customize-mapnik-map >$MAPNIK_MAP_FILE

You can now call

  ./generate_tiles.py

or 

  ./generate_image.py

to generate maps.


Files and Directories
---------------------

all_tiles
    ??

convert
    OBSOLETE. Use customize-mapnik-map instead.

customize-mapnik-map
    Run this script to convert osm-template.xml into osm.xml with your
    settings.

generate_image.py
    A script to generate a map image from OSM data using Mapnik. Will
    read mapping instructions from $MAPNIK_MAP_FILE (or 'osm.xml') and
    write the finished map to 'image.png'. You have to change the script
    to change the bounding box or image size.

generate_tiles.py
    A script to generate map tiles from OSM data using Mapnik. Will
    read mapping instructions from $MAPNIK_MAP_FILE (or 'osm.xml') and
    write the finished maps to the $MAPNIK_TILE_DIR directory. You have
    to change the script to change the bounding boxes or zoom levels
    for which tiles are created.

install.txt
    An almost cut-and-paste documentation on how to use all this.

mkshield.pl
    Perl script to generate highway shield images. You normally don't
    have to run this because prerendered images are already stored in
    the 'symbols' directory.

openstreetmap-mapnik-data
openstreetmap-mapnik-world-boundaries
    These directories contain the things needed to create Debian packages
    for OSM Mapnik stuff.

osm-template.xml
    A template for the osm.xml file which contains the rules on how
    Mapnik should render data.

osm.xml
    The file which contains the rules on how Mapnik should render data.
    You should generate your own version from the osm-template.xml file.

osm2pgsl.py
    Older script to read OSM data into a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. Use
    the newer C version in ../../utils/export/osm2pgsql instead!

set-mapnik-env
    Used to customize the environment needed by the other Mapnik OSM
    scripts.

setup_z_order.sql
    SQL commands to set up Z order for rendering. This is included in
    the C version of osm2pgsql in ../../utils/export/osm2pgsql, so you
    don't need this any more.

symbols
    Directory with icons and highway shield images.
